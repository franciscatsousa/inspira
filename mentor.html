                        individuals within the tech field. They need to be committed to sharing insights and supporting
                        the academic growth of less experienced peers, regardless of gender, contract type, or status. 
                        Being a mentor doesn't hinge on holding a senior position, it's rather about having experience
                        and a desire to help and support others.</div>

                        by sharing experiences and knowledge. They must be available throughout the academic year,
                        communicate effectively, uphold confidentiality, and provide feedback when needed. In case of
                        any program-related issues, mentors should contact program coordination for assistance. Mentors
                        are also encouraged to run public events on topics of their choice.</div>

                        revitalizing interest in their one’s work through self-assessment and discovering rising
                        talents. Mentors also can share experiences and knowledge, expand networking opportunities,
                        boost self-esteem and leadership skills, and attend lectures on mentoring and the importance of
                        women in Informatics. Mentors also earn a mentor certificate at the end of each mentoring cycle.
