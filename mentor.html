          <div class="paragraph">
            Mentors, whether students, researchers, or faculty members, are
            experienced individuals within the tech field. They need to be
            committed to sharing insights and supporting the academic growth
            of less experienced peers, regardless of gender, contract type, or
            status.  Being a mentor doesn't hinge on holding a senior
            position, it's rather about having experience and a desire to help
            and support others.

          <div class="paragraph">
            The mentor plays a crucial role in assisting the mentee in skill
            development by sharing experiences and knowledge. They must be
            available throughout the academic year, communicate effectively,
            uphold confidentiality, and provide feedback when needed. In case
            of any program-related issues, mentors should contact program
            coordination for assistance. Mentors are also encouraged to run
            public events on topics of their choice.

            work through self-assessment and discovering rising talents.
            Mentors also can share experiences and knowledge, expand
            networking opportunities, boost self-esteem and leadership skills,
            and attend lectures on mentoring and the importance of women in
            Informatics. Mentors also earn a mentor certificate at the end of
            each mentoring cycle.

              In January 2021, Sunny Miranda made the decision to temporarily step away from her position as Information
              Technology (IT) Analyst at the Federal University of Alagoas in Brazil to pursue her Ph.D. at the
              University of Coimbra in Portugal. Her primary focus is on deepening her studies on gender disparity in
              the IT field. Her research centers around the teaching and learning of programming in primary education,
              aiming to identify best practices to enhance girls' interest in IT. Additionally, Sunny is dedicated to
              investigating the factors that influence students in choosing IT-related courses in higher education.
              <br /><br />Sunny holds a master's degree in Computational Knowledge Modeling with a specialization in
              Informatics in Education, where she conducted a research project focused on improving learning and
              interaction among students in a Distance Education (EaD) environment. A graduate in Computer Science, she

            Collaborating with INSPIRA has been a unique experience. With each meeting, we reinforce the idea that
            everyone has something to teach and learn, and with mutual support, we can create an environment more
            conducive to female presence in Information Technology, as well as greater diversity in the field.

            Participating as a mentor has represented mutual learning on various levels. Understanding how I can support
            someone else with both my current experience and the necessary research to meet my mentee's needs allows me
            to grow. Collaboration and learning without any kind of hierarchy or shame is something that would make the
            world a better place on a large scale.
            Thank you, INSPIRA.
